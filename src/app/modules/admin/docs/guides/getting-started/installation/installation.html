                Before you begin installing Treo, prepare a folder where you can unzip the downloaded .zip file.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Choose which version you want to install</h2>
            <p>
                When you unzip the .zip file you have downloaded from Themeforest, you will find 2 additional .zip files along with other files. One of those .zip files is the
                <strong>Demo</strong> version, and the other one is the <strong>Starter</strong> version:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Demo <code>treo-demo-vX.X.X.zip</code></strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This .zip file includes the Demo version which includes all the applications, pages and UI sections from the Demo application. This version is for referencing
                        purposes only and it should be only used for copying code/modules from it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Do <strong>NOT</strong> use the Demo version to build your app, otherwise you will have a lot of unnecessary weight to your app right from the start and it
                        will provide a poor development experience.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Starter <code>treo-starter-vX.X.X.zip</code></strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This .zip file includes the Starter version which includes all the core components and functionality of Treo <em>without</em> the Demo applications,
                        pages and UI sections. <strong>DO</strong> use the Starter version to build your app on top.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Unzip</h2>
            <p>
                After choosing the version you want to install, unzip the .zip file of that version into your workspace directory.
            </p>
            <treo-message appearance="outline"
                          [showIcon]="false"

                    You can completely skip the steps <strong>#1</strong> and <strong>#2</strong> and instead fork the project from Treo's Github repo directly. This will not only
                    make things simpler, but it will also make any future updates easier as you can merge the changes from the original repo into your fork.
                </div>
                <div class="mt-2">
                    For more information and to access Treo's Github repo, check out the Treo's Themeforest description page.

            </treo-message>

            <h2>3. Run the installation command</h2>
            <p>
                Open a console/terminal window and navigate into your workspace directory. You must be at the same folder with the <code>package.json</code> file in order to run
                the commands.
            </p>
            <p>
                To complete the installation, enter the following command:
            </p>
            <textarea treo-highlight
                      lang="bash">
                npm install
            </textarea>
            <p>
                This command will take some time and install all the required libraries into the <strong>node_modules</strong> directory in order for you to start developing.
            </p>
            <treo-message appearance="outline"
                          type="info">
                <div>
                    After the installation completes, you may see warnings about deprecated packages and security risks. You can safely ignore those messages as Treo (and other
                    Angular apps) use Node.js for only development environment.
                </div>
                <div class="mt-4">
                    Unless you explicitly add a package to your <strong>dependencies</strong> list in <em>package.json</em> file, they won't be included into the final application
                    therefore they are not going cause any security risks.
