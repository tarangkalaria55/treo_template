                Since Treo uses Angular Material, it's also possible to use their Table component. It offers base features like filtering, sorting and pagination as well as
                some advanced ones like column re-ordering, column and row freezing and expandable rows.

                To keep this page simple and the Demo app as light as possible, we didn't add any examples here. Examples already can be found throughout the Demo app and also the
                official Angular Material documentation has plenty of examples to get you started.
