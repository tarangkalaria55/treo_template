                The <strong>splash screen</strong> is the screen that shows up when your app is loading. It's <strong>NOT</strong> just a cosmetic screen or something that you can
                make <em>faster</em>, it simply shows up while Angular loads and hides immediately after it finishes loading.
            </p>

            <h2>How it works?</h2>
            <p>
                When you first arrive your app via its website address, the <strong>index.html</strong> loads first. It has all the required scripts injected in it by the
                AngularCLI, so as soon as it loads, it also starts loading the required script files.
            </p>
            <p>
                After those required script files loaded, Angular starts the Bootstrapping progress and loads the first component (usually the <em>AppComponent</em>). Then
                <em>AppComponent</em> takes over and loads other modules and components and your app starts running.
            </p>
            <p>
                While all of these happening, you will see nothing on the screen simply because the <strong>index.html</strong> file has nothing in it except the script injections
                and the entry point for your <em>AppComponent</em>. That's where the <strong>splash screen</strong> comes into play and hides the <em>white screen of loading</em>.
            </p>

            <h2>Customizing the screen</h2>
            <p>
                All splash screen related content stays in the <code>index.html</code> file, there are some inline styles as well as the <code>treo-splash-screen</code> dummy
                element which holds everything related to the splash screen. This element is not an actual Angular component, it's just a simple wrapper to hold everything you may
                want to show on the splash screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can change the inline styles to modify the look of the splash screen and put anything you want into the <code>treo-splash-screen</code> element to show on the
                page.
            </p>
            <treo-message appearance="outline"
                          type="info">
                Please note, you cannot run Angular components in here. Basically, by the time you can run Angular components, you won't be needing the
                <strong>splash screen</strong> because everything would already be loaded!
            </treo-message>
            <p>
                If you don't want to show the splash screen and you are happy with the <em>white screen of loading</em>, then you can simply remove the
                <code>treo-splash-screen</code> dummy element from the <strong>index.html</strong> file.
            </p>
