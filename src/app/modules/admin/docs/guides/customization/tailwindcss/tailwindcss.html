                As per the official page of Tailwind CSS, it is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke
                designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.
            </p>
            <p>
                To simply put, Tailwind provides helper classes for almost every CSS rule available.
            </p>
            <p>
                Treo includes Tailwind by default and it can be used in any part of the theme. Majority of Treo's pages and apps still use the traditional styling with
                ids and classes but they can be easily improved and modified using Tailwind. If you choose to use Tailwind as your main styling framework and don't want to use
                traditional ids and classes for styling, you can always create apps and pages and use the helper classes from Tailwind to style them.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also choose to use Tailwind as a helper classes utility rather than your main style framework. Basically, you would still create id/class based styles
                for complex styling and layouts and use only certain parts of the Tailwind to modify your styles, like quickly adding <b>margin</b> and <b>padding</b> to the
                elements, or <b>showing</b> and/or <b>hiding</b> them based on breakpoints to create better mobile/table layouts without writing media queries all the time.
            </p>

            <h2>Configuration</h2>
            <p>
                To use Tailwind, you don't need to do any setup as all Tailwind classes can be accessible from any HTML file you create by default.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tailwind configuration can be found in <code>/src/tailwind/config.js</code> file. This file is used to configure the generated classes by Tailwind. We already
                configured the Tailwind using the config file to provide sensible defaults for a web app.
            </p>
            <p>
                The generated scss file is located at the <code>/src/styles/tailwind.scss</code> and it's being included as one of the main style files in the building process
                using <code>angular.json</code> configuration.
            </p>

            <h2>Tailwind and Treo</h2>
            <p>
                Treo also uses Tailwind as the main configuration for things like <strong>colors</strong>, <strong>font families and sizes</strong>,
                <strong>breakpoints</strong>, <strong>shadows</strong> and more. Basically, some of the Tailwind configuration is exported during the Tailwind's build process to
                make them available as SCSS variables. This allows Treo to use Tailwind's configuration as the single source of truth. This way, if you want to have another
                color defined for your app, it will be available in both Treo as SCSS variable and in the Tailwind as a utility class.
            </p>
            <p>
                To summarize; if you want to add/edit/remove any color, change the font families, modify the breakpoints or change any other visual configuration, you have to do
                that via the Tailwind's config file and then build the Tailwind.
            </p>

            <h2>Building Tailwind</h2>
            <p>
                If you modify the Tailwind configuration file, you have to run the
            </p>
            <textarea treo-highlight
                      lang="bash">
                npm run tw
            </textarea>
            <p>
                command to compile and build a new <code>tailwind.scss</code> file. The Tailwind configuration file is not being watched by AngularCLI so any changes on that file
                <b>won't</b> trigger the Tailwind's building process automatically.
            </p>
